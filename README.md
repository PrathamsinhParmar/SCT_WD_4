# Task Manager 🎯

A simple, web-based Task Manager built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. 
Manage your to‑do list: create, edit, complete, filter, and clear tasks—all handled client-side without frameworks.

## 🧩 Features

- **Add Task**: Input a task and click “Add Task” to append it to your “All” list.
- **Mark Complete**: Click a task’s checkbox to mark it as done—moves to the “Completed” tab.
- **Edit Task**: Modify an existing task inline, saving or canceling your edit.
- **Filter Tabs**: Switch between “All”, “Active”, and “Completed” views to organize tasks.
- **Clear Completed**: Remove all completed tasks with one click.
- **Responsive UI**: Minimal, intuitive interface.

## ⚙️ How It Works

- Tasks are stored in JavaScript arrays, categorized as **Active** or **Completed**.
- DOM manipulation handles updates: rendering task lists, toggling edit inputs, and dynamically updating counts.
- Event listeners manage user actions (add, mark, edit, delete).

## ✅ Getting Started

2. Open `index.html` in your browser.
